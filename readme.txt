Description of the codes These codes were used to create the global net-migration dataset that is published in Niva et al (2023). Please do cite to this paper if using the code. Niva et al. 2023. World's human migration patterns in 2000Ð2019 unveiled by high-resolution data. Nature Human Behaviour XX: TBA. Doi: TBA.ÊThe output data is available at: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7997134The code is divided into following sections (i.e. folders):1. Data preparation for births and death ratios as well as independent variables for downscaling (1_preparing_data -folder)2. Downscaling birth and death ratios from adm1 level to gridded level (2_downscaling_BirthsDeaths -folder)3. Calculating the net-migration from birth and death ratios and reported population change (3_net_migration_setup -folder)4. Analyses for the paper (4_analyses -folder)5. Validation of birth and death downscaling, used population data as well as net-migration estimates (5_validation -folder)
