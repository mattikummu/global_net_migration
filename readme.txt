Description of the codes 

These codes were used to create the global net-migration dataset that is published in Niva et al (2023). Please do cite this paper if using the codes. 

Niva et al. 2023. World's human migration patterns in 2000-2019 unveiled by high-resolution data. Nature Human Behaviour 7: 2023â€“2037. Doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01689-4 

The output data is available at:

To keep the folder structure, please extract all zip files to the same folder where the code folders are. The folder should look like this:

* Reproducibility * 

Please note: all the scripts are not yet reproducible - we are working hard to get all the used input data into zenodo. Apologies for this. 

Here are details: 

- the downscaling part (section 2) is not reproducible but output from that is stored in data_out_downscaling, and thus following sections can be run. 

- under analyses folder (section 4), two scripts (5_socio_climatic_bins.R (aridity map is missing), 6_socio_climatic_bins_analysis.R (needs information from 5_socio_climatic_bins.R)) are not reproducible yet. 

- under validation folder (section 5), the 4_net_migration_validation.R is not reproducible yet. 


* Code structure *

The code is divided into following sections (i.e. folders):
1. Data preparation for births and death ratios as well as independent variables for downscaling (1_preparing_data -folder)
2. Downscaling birth and death ratios from adm1 level to gridded level (2_downscaling_BirthsDeaths -folder)
3. Calculating the net-migration from birth and death ratios and reported population change (3_net_migration_setup -folder)
4. Analyses for the paper (4_analyses -folder)
5. Validation of birth and death downscaling, used population data as well as net-migration estimates (5_validation -folder)
