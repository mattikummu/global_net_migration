Description of the codes These codes were used to create the global net-migration dataset that is published in Niva et al (2023). Please do cite this paper if using the codes. Niva et al. 2023. World's human migration patterns in 2000-2019 unveiled by high-resolution data. Nature Human Behaviour XX: TBA. Doi: TBA 
(in press; see preprint at https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1827424/v1)The output data is available at: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7997134The code is divided into following sections (i.e. folders):1. Data preparation for births and death ratios as well as independent variables for downscaling (1_preparing_data -folder)2. Downscaling birth and death ratios from adm1 level to gridded level (2_downscaling_BirthsDeaths -folder)3. Calculating the net-migration from birth and death ratios and reported population change (3_net_migration_setup -folder)4. Analyses for the paper (4_analyses -folder)5. Validation of birth and death downscaling, used population data as well as net-migration estimates (5_validation -folder)
